# Inconnu

Inconnu is a tool for pseudonymizing data, anonymizing data, and making data more private. It aims to be compliant with GDPR and other privacy regulations.

> GDPR compliance for LLMs primarily hinges on several key principles: lawfulness, fairness, transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, and confidentiality

## Checklist for Anonymizing Data
1. Robust Anonymization Process:
- Ensure that the anonymization process removes all personal identifiers and that the data cannot be re-identified using any reasonably available means.
- Use techniques such as data masking, pseudonymization, generalization, or differential privacy.

2. Legal Standards for Anonymization:
- Verify that the anonymized data meets the GDPR criteria, ensuring it is no longer considered personal data.
- Consult with legal experts to confirm that your anonymization process complies with GDPR standards.

3. Documentation and Transparency:
- Document the anonymization process and maintain records of the techniques used.
- Inform customers and stakeholders about the anonymization process and its compliance with legal requirements.

4. Risk Assessment:
- Conduct a risk assessment to evaluate the potential for re-identification.
- Implement additional controls if necessary to mitigate any identified risks.

5. Regular Review:
- Regularly review and update the anonymization process to address any new risks or changes in technology or legal standards.
