RESEARCH INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT
Study: Remote Work Impact on Mental Health
Participant ID: INT-2024-045
Date: March 28, 2024
Interviewer: Dr. Emily Chen, Stanford University
Duration: 45 minutes

[00:00] Dr. Chen: Thank you for participating. Can you introduce yourself?

[00:15] Participant: I'm Robert Martinez, I work as a Senior Developer at
CloudTech Inc. I've been working remotely from my home in Austin, Texas
since March 2020. I live at 789 Oak Street with my wife Maria and our
two kids, aged 8 and 10.

[01:30] Dr. Chen: How has remote work affected your work-life balance?

[01:45] Participant: It's been challenging. My manager, Susan Lee, expects
me to be available from 8 AM to 6 PM. Her email is slee@cloudtech.com if
you need to verify. My doctor, Dr. James Park at Austin Medical Center
(512-555-7890), prescribed anxiety medication last year.

[03:20] Dr. Chen: Can you describe a typical workday?

[03:35] Participant: I wake up at 6:30, check emails from our Mumbai team
led by Raj Patel. By 9 AM, I'm in meetings. My colleague Jennifer Brown
(she's at 555-234-5678) and I pair program most afternoons. We use my
personal Zoom account (robert.martinez@gmail.com) when company servers
are slow.

[05:10] Dr. Chen: Have you discussed these challenges with anyone?

[05:25] Participant: Yes, with my therapist Dr. Lisa Anderson at Better
Mind Clinic on Lamar Boulevard. Also with my brother Carlos who works at
Dell (carlos.martinez@dell.com). He's experiencing similar issues.

[07:00] Dr. Chen: What support would help?

[07:15] Participant: Better boundaries. My skip-level manager, VP David
Wilson, suggested a 4-day workweek. His assistant Karen (x4567) sent me
some research about it. My wife works at IBM (maria.m@ibm.com) and they
have better policies.

FOCUS GROUP TRANSCRIPT
Topic: Consumer Preferences for Sustainable Products
Date: March 28, 2024
Moderator: Market Research Inc.
Location: Seattle Conference Center, Room 205

PARTICIPANTS:
1. Jessica Wong - Teacher, age 34, Bellevue (jessica.w.teacher@email.com)
2. Michael Thompson - Engineer at Boeing, age 45 (mthompson@boeing.com)
3. Sarah Ahmed - Small business owner, age 28 (sarah@greencafe.com)
4. David Lee - Retired, age 67, lives at Sunrise Senior Living
5. Emma Rodriguez - Student at UW, age 22 (emma.r@uw.edu)

[Moderator]: What influences your purchasing decisions?

[Jessica]: Price is important. As a teacher at Lincoln Elementary making
$65,000/year, I have to budget carefully. My husband Tom works at Microsoft
(tom.wong@microsoft.com) but we still watch spending.

[Michael]: Quality matters more. I learned this from my father, Robert
Thompson, who ran Thompson's Hardware on Pike Street for 30 years.

[Sarah]: For my caf√© at 456 Green Street, I prioritize local suppliers.
I work with Johnson Farms (contact: Bill Johnson at 206-555-8901).

[David]: At my age, convenience is key. My daughter Lisa (425-555-2345)
helps me order online. My social security and pension from Boeing total
about $4,500/month.

[Emma]: Environmental impact! My environmental science professor, Dr. Kumar
(rkumar@uw.edu), taught us about carbon footprints. I shop at the co-op
on 45th Street where my roommate Katie Chen works.

[Michael]: Speaking of environment, my wife Jennifer is on the city council
(jthompson@seattle.gov). She mentioned new regulations coming.
