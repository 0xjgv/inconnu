This is the THIRD time I'm writing about this! You charged my Visa ending
in 8901 three times for the same subscription! Each charge was $49.99.

My account number is ACC-123456 and I've been a customer since 2018. This
is completely unacceptable. If this isn't resolved TODAY, I'm calling my
bank to dispute all charges and posting on Twitter (@mikethompson_real).

Dear Michael,

I sincerely apologize for this billing error. I'm Sarah from the Billing
Department and I'll personally ensure this is resolved today.

I can confirm we see the triple charge on your Visa ending 8901. I've:
1. Initiated refunds for the two duplicate charges ($99.98 total)
2. Added a $20 credit to your account for the inconvenience
3. Escalated to our VP of Customer Success, James Wilson

The refunds will appear in 3-5 business days. Reference: REF-2024-7890
