Healthcare Records Anonymization Example

This example demonstrates how to use Inconnu to anonymize sensitive medical data
including patient records, clinical notes, and research data while maintaining
HIPAA compliance and data utility for medical research.

Use Cases:
- Patient admission forms
- Medical consultation notes
- Prescription records
- Clinical trial data
- Medical research datasets

1. HIPAA Compliance:
   - Always use pseudonymization for data that may need de-identification
   - Store entity mappings securely and separately from anonymized data
   - Implement access controls and audit logging

2. Custom Identifiers:
   - Add patterns for MRN, trial IDs, and facility-specific codes
   - Consider regional variations in ID formats

3. Performance Considerations:
   - Use batch processing for large datasets
   - Consider async processing for web applications
   - Monitor processing times for SLA compliance

4. Data Retention:
   - Configure retention policies based on regulations
   - Implement secure deletion of entity mappings
   - Maintain audit trails for compliance

5. Quality Assurance:
   - Validate anonymization completeness
   - Test with diverse data formats
   - Regular updates for new entity types
