Subject: Fraudulent Charges on Credit Card
Date: March 25, 2024

Dear MegaBank,

I am writing to report unauthorized transactions on my credit card ending in 4532.
My name is Robert Chen, and my account number is 1234-5678-9012-4532.

On March 23, 2024, I noticed the following suspicious charges:
1. $2,500 at "Luxury Electronics" in Miami, FL (I live in Seattle, WA)
2. $1,200 at "Designer Boutique" in Miami, FL
3. $800 cash advance at ATM location 12345 in Miami Beach

I have not traveled to Florida. My card was in my possession at my home address:
789 Pine Street, Apt 45, Seattle, WA 98101.

Please investigate immediately. You can reach me at:
- Phone: (206) 555-9876
- Alt Phone: (206) 555-4321
- Work: Microsoft Corporation, Building 42

I've already filed a police report (Case #2024-12345) with Officer James Wilson.

My mother, Linda Chen (425-555-1111), is an authorized user and can verify she
hasn't made these charges either.

Sincerely,
Robert Chen
